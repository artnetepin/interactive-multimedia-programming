    What is the purpose of the RWD? Why it is used? How things are done
    before RWD? What is the difference?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Purpose of RWD is to create flexible webpages that will look good on all devices using CSS Media Queries (the number and popularity of which is quite big nowadays). Evolution and growth of usage of these devices for web-purposes is the main reason of
    using RWD. That's why nowadays the way of "mobile-first" development became essential. Before RWD things were more desktop-oriented, the most responsiveness were applied with fluid grids to make the content scalable. But this approach doesnt work
    as good for lower resolutions and smaller viewports. The main difference between ways of RWD and Fluid layout is that the first one uses CSS Media Queries to show different layouts based on screen sizes and types, whereas the second one is based on
    laying out the content so, that elements take up the same percentage of space depending on screen size.
  </p>
  <h1>Take screenshots of the sites on different devices and screen sizes.</h1>
  <div class="images">
    <img src="images/boston-1.png" alt="" class="screenshots">
    <img src="images/boston-2.png" alt="" class="screenshots">
    <img src="images/boston-3.png" alt="" class="screenshots">

  <h1>how could you prevent user zooming the site on mobile?</h1>
  <p>
    Zooming on mobile can be disabled using "user-scalable=no" option for "meta viewport"
  </p>
  <h1>Can you say why you should use it in addition to standard img elements?</h1>
  <p>
    Images are not directly inserted into a page, they are linked to the page. The '
    < 'img'>' tag creates a holding space for the referenced image, whereas the content of the '
      < 'figure'>' element is related to the main flow, but its position is independent of that and if figure element is removed, it doesntt affect the flow of the document.
