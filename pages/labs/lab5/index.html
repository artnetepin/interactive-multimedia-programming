    <dt>What are CDNs? What kind of benefits you get if you use them?</dt>
    <dd>
      CDNs are content delivery distributed networks used for Web content delivery with high performance and availability. The most common use of CDN for Web development is including different CSS/JS framework files (jQuery, Bootstrap, JS plugins) from the
      CDN. This increases, for instance, the perfomance of webpage in the way that it doesn't load those framework files from the local storage.
